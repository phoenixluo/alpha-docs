# Payments and verification

**Billing → Payments** handles receipts and bank slip verification.

## The page

Two figures at the top: how many are **Pending Verification**, and **Total Payments**.

Below, two tabs:

| Tab | Shows |
|---|---|
| **All Payments** | Every receipt |
| **Pending Verification** | Slips uploaded but not yet confirmed |

Filters: **User code**, **Reference** and **Status**.

## Verifying a bank slip

After a customer transfers and uploads a slip (see [Invoices](./invoices)), it lands in
**Pending Verification**:

1. Open one.
2. Check the **amount, date and payer** against the invoice.
3. Pass it, and only then is the money treated as received.

If it doesn't match, send it back and ask the customer for the right document.

:::warning
**Verification is a control, not a formality.** Passing it moves the invoice status and
the customer's balance. Don't click through without looking.

## Receiving bank accounts

**Receiving Bank Accounts** in the top right opens the account maintenance page — the
accounts you collect into, and what customers see when they transfer.

:::note
That page **isn't in the Settings menu**; this is the way in.

## Permissions

Recording payments and verifying slips need the **Payments** permission. Adjusting a
sender account's wallet balance by hand is a separate grant
(**Wallet Adjustment**), because it moves a balance with no receipt behind it.
