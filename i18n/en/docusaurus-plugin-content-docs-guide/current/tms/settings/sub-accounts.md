# Sub accounts and permissions

**Settings → Sub Accounts** manages your colleagues' accounts and what each of them can
do.

## The list

Each person shows a status (**Active** / **Inactive** / **Suspended**) and their granted
permissions. Long lists collapse into "**+N more**". Someone with none shows
**No Permissions** — that account can see almost nothing after signing in.

## Adding someone

Create the account with their email and details; the system sends an invitation and they
set their own password. See [Signing up and signing in](../getting-started/signup).

## Ticking permissions

Permissions come in groups, and groups have finer sub-permissions. **Ticking the group
grants all of it**, or tick only the sub-permissions you want.

| Group | What it covers | Sub-permissions |
|---|---|---|
| Scan | Scanning | By station: Pickup, Inbound, Sort, Outbound, Delivery |
| Waybills | Create, update, cancel, assign to subcontractors | — |
| Deliveries | Create deliveries, assign drivers | Address Preprocessing / Create / Assign |
| Customer Service | Customer enquiries and tickets | Customer Channels / Driver Channels |
| Partner Management | Partners | Subcontractor Management / Drivers |
| System Settings | System configuration | User / Organization / Automation / Service Area / Label Template |
| Billing | The Billing menu and its everyday work | Rate Cards / Payments / Wallet Adjustment |

## Things worth thinking about

**Scan permissions are granted per station.** Give a sorter only Scan → Sort and the
event type dropdown on their phone shows only sorting. That's exactly why
[driver scanning](../driver/scan) can show a one-item list — it isn't a fault.

**The Billing group is the menu's master switch.** Without it, the whole Billing menu is
absent from the bar.

**Wallet Adjustment is separate for a reason.** It allows someone to **change a
customer's prepaid balance with no payment behind it**. Think before granting it.

**The organization owner holds every permission** and can't be configured here.

## Deactivating and suspending

When someone leaves, **deactivate** the account rather than deleting it — the waybills,
deliveries and actions they handled still reference it.
