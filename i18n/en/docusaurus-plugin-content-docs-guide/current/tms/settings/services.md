# Services and service areas

## Services

**Settings → Services** defines the delivery services you sell and how each one prices.

The top of the page shows **Total Services**, **Service Types in Use** and their
distribution.

After creating a service you're told you can now configure **provider services** and
**add-ons** — a service can be backed by third-party carrier capability and carry extra
options.

Services are required in a lot of places: [importing waybills](../waybills/import) needs
one, [consolidation](../waybills/consolidate) requires the **same service**, and rate
cards attach to them. So services are the layer to settle first.

## Service areas

**Settings → Service Areas** manages delivery zones, with **Total Service Areas**,
**Active Service Areas** and **Postal Codes Covered** across the top.

**Add Service Area** creates one. An area can be **drawn on the map** or defined by
**postal code coverage**.

Service areas are used for:

- one of the three required selectors in [delivery planning](../delivery/planning) — a
  trip stays within one area;
- a filter on the [waybill list](../waybills/list);
- a condition on [automation rules](./automation).

:::tip Don't slice them too finely
The more areas you cut, the more often planning turns up "two consignments for this zone
today". Draw them the way you actually run vehicles, and split later if you must.
